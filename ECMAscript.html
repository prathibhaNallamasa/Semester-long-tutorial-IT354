              <h1>ECMAscript</h1>
              <h2>What is ECMAscript</h2>
              <p>
                  According to wikipedia, ECMAscript is a scripting language standardized by the ECMA International.
                  JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript.
                  ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js
              <br>
              </p>
              <h2>History of ECMA</h2>
              <p>
              The committee that standardizes ECMAScript is called TC39. Its members are major browser vendors, other companies.
              JavaScript was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich while at Netscape, reportedly in only 10 days. 
              It was originally named Mocha, a name chosen by Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, but was renamed four months later to LiveScript. 
              At that time, Sun Microsystems owned the trademark for JavaScript. Netscape acquired a trademark license and renamed LiveScript to JavaScript in December 1995. 
              It was somewhat of a marketing maneuver since Java was really popular at the time. The languages are not related at all.  
              In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the Ecma International standards organization to advance the standardization of JavaScript.
              The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then.
               The name "ECMAScript" was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft.
               <br>
               <br>
               All features in ECMAScript go through a formal proposal process. 
               A proposal for a new feature, usually originating from the developer community, begins with a sketch or “strawman proposal” that provides an initial description of the proposed feature. 
               If TC39 agrees that the feature is valuable, it will be promoted to official “Proposal” status.
              The deadline for ES6 proposals was way back in May 2011.
          </p>
  
          <h2>ECMAscript4</h2>
          <p>
              The work for ECMAscript4 began in early 2000's <br>
              when the committee got together they were divided into 2 separate camps.
               In one corner was the “ECMAScript 4 Camp,” composed of Adobe, Mozilla, Opera & Google, who still wanted to work towards the massive upgrade. 
              In the other corner was Microsoft & Yahoo, the “ECMAScript 3.1 Camp”, seeking a small subset of ES4, which would be more of an incremental upgrade of ES3 containing some minor features and bug fixes.
              <br>
              <br>
              In July 2008, at a meeting in Oslo, Norway it was decided that the ECMAscript 3.1 would become ECMAscript 5.
              And ECMAscript 4 along with some bigger scope would be released as ECMAscript6 which was codenamed as <I>Harmony.</I>
      
          </p>
          <h2>ECMAscript 5</h2>
          <p>
              It was released in December 2009.
              It is the version of JavaScript that is fully supported in all the browsers in use today except for Internet Explorer 8.
              It made several enhancements to standard library like<br><br>
  
             JSON parsing<br>
                  Array prototype methods(like map)<br>
                  Methods for listing properties of an object
              <br><br>
              also syntactic updates like
              <br><br>
                      Allowances for dangling commas at the end of lists or object definitions
  
                  <br>
                      Allowances for reserved words
                  </p>
              <h2>ECMAscript2019</h2>
              <p>
                  The 10th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2019, was published in June 2019.
                  The features include Array.Prototype.Flat and Array.Prototype.FlatMap
