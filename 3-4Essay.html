                <h2>Principles of good website usability</h2>

                <h3>1. Availability and Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Server uptime: </strong>
                    It is important to make sure that the users do not find any errors
                    in trying to load the site. Invest in good hosting<br>
                    <strong>Broken links:</strong>
                    Make sure that there are no dead links in your website.<br>
                    <strong>Mobile responsiveness:</strong>
                    Make sure your website is responsive to different types of devices and 
                    display of your site is good in all types of devices<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>2. Clarity</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Simplicity :</strong>
                    Focus on what is important and do not try to confuse or distract the users with any unwanted animations.<br>
                    <strong>Familiarity:</strong>
                    Sticking with what people already know makes it more easier for the users to interact with you website.<br>
                    <strong>Consistency: </strong>
                    Keep your website as consistent as possible, this creates a positive vibe for the users.<br>
                    <strong>Guidance:</strong>
                    Guide your visitors on what they can do on your website and do not make them feel like an adventure when visiting your website.<br>
                    <strong>Direct feedback:</strong> 
                    Feedback is essential to any interaction. The moment people interact with your site, 
                    make sure to offer an indication of success or failure of their actions.<br>
                    <strong>Good information architecture:</strong>
                    Understand your visitors’ mental models and how they would expect you to structure the content on your site.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>3. Learnability</h3>
                <p>
                    People are already familiar with web concepts, following those concepts,
                    it is easy to meet their requirements.As human beings, we like patterns and recognition, 
                    which is why we are better at handling familiar situations rather than unfamiliar ones.
                    you can offer additional information, or instructions the first time they use your site or product. 
                    Keep it simple and visual to help people remember new concepts.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Credibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Even if people find the content they are looking for, if they don’t trust you, that content is worthless.
                     Your website could cause site visitors to be skeptical about your business in any number of ways including whether or 
                     not you really exist, your reputation, or the quality of your content.

It is important that people know you are a real company with real people.
 Offer a clear “About Us” page together with your contact details and if possible a physical address.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Relevancy</h3>
                <p>
                    It is not enough that your website is clear, your content must also be relevant. 
                    Again, it is essential that you know your users and why they visit your site.

Start with defining who your users are. Second, talk to them to find out what their goals are when visiting your site.
 Third, define user scenarios that demonstrate in which situation people visit your site to find what kind of content. 
Any design decision that you make should result in a more user-friendly website for your users.
