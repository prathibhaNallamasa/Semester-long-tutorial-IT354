            <h1>Common Usability Blunders</h1>
            <p>
                The 3 usability issues I choose are the following :

            </p>
            <h2>Contents difficult to scan</h2>
            <p>
                The design of the website is not the only way to ensure that the website is usable, 
                you also need a good copy.<br>
                <br>
                "Copy" is the term used for all the text content on a website.<br>
            Design is the feature that enables the visitors to guide around the website, 
            helps to focus their attention on the things that matter, but they will still need to read the text to process the information.
            This is where the copy makes an essential part of your website.<br><br>
            Visitors do not read the whole text from your website.You need a good copy to arrange your text in such a way
            that the visitors find it easy ti scan through the whole text without the need to read each and every
            line from top to bottom.<br><br>
            The websites provide people with a lot of information and most of us try to consume all the 
            information as much as possible. this leads to a very frantic behaviour where we skip from
            one piece of text to another or one website to another.<br>
            To avoid this problem, we need to keep in mind the following before creating the copy.<br><br>
            <h4>
                  -  Have a few points to focus with large, straong and higher contrast colors and fonts.
                    using of icons, next to the text to give these areas even more visual pull.
                <br><br><br>
                
                   - The focus points need to have a descriptive heading. These headings need to be clear and the visitors should be able to
                    understand it without any problem. Don’t make headings mysterious or vague to draw people in. Keep them informative yet concise.
<br><br><br>

                
                   - Any other text in website should be short and easy to understand. Provide only the important points and skip the rest.

                <br><br></h4>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Too Much Functionality That Requires Registration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your website has many functionalities and features which are put behind a Registration
                        shield. But we need to be carefull about what we are putting behind the shield. Most of the websites have their 100%
                        of their features behind the registartion and some provide most pf their features without any prior
                        registration.
                        <br><br>
                        When you implement a log-in barrier, be careful that you don’t lock away features that don’t really need user identification. 
                        Some blogs require people to register before posting. Sure, that will significantly decrease spam, 
                        but it will also significantly decrease the number of comments you see, too.<br><br>
                        User participation in our website depends on the registration shields, if there is any registration or login required 
                        not all the people are interested to spend their time in the registration.
                    </p>
            <h2>Long Registration Forms</h2>
            <p>
                Registration forms are barriers. They are barriers because it takes effort to fill them in, 
                and the task itself is no fun. People have to invest time and effort to register, 
                and then they have to invest even more time and effort in future to remember what user name and password they used.
<br>
We can shrink this barrier by making the sign-up form as short as possible. At the end of the day,
 the purpose of a registration system is simply to be able to identify each user; so, the only requirements are a unique identifier, 
 such as a user name or email address, and a password. 
If you don’t need more information, don’t ask for it. Keep the form short.
