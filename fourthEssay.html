            <h1>Monolith vs Microservices</h1>
            <p>
                The evolution of technologies has changed the way we build the architecture of applications.
                 Docker, Cloud services, and Container Orchestration services brought us ability to develop 
                 distributed, more scalable, and reliable solutions. In this article, we will compare microservices
                  and monolith architecture, discuss what teams 
                and projects should use what type of architecture, and explore their advantages and disadvantages.
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Monolith architecture</h2>
            <p>The monolithic architecture is considered to be a traditional way of building applications.
                 A monolithic application is built as a single and indivisible unit. Usually, such a solution
                  comprises a client-side user interface, a server side-application, and a database.
                   It is unified and all the functions are managed and served in one place.

                Normally, monolithic applications have one large code base and lack modularity.
                 If developers want to update or change something, they access the same code base.
                  So, they make changes in the whole stack at once.</p><br><br>
                  <h2>Microservices architectures</h2>
                  <p>
                    Within a microservices architecture, the entire functionality is split up into independently
                     deployable modules which communicate with each other through defined methods called 
                     APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Each service covers its own scope and can
                      be updated, deployed, and scaled independently.
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h2>Benefits of monolith architecture</h2>
                  <p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                            Less cross-cutting concerns. Cross-cutting concerns are the concerns that affect 
                            the whole application such as logging, handling, caching, and performance monitoring. 
                            In a monolithic application, 
                            this area of functionality concerns only one application so it is easier to handle it.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Development is quite simple.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Scalability : is simple. We just need to have a new instance of the monolithic application and
                             ask the load balancer to distribute load to the new instance as well. 
                            However, as the monolithic application grows in size, scalability becomes a serious issue.
                          </li>
                          <li>Simple to deploy. Another advantage associated with the simplicity of monolithic apps
                               is easier deployment. When it comes to monolithic applications,
                               you do not have to handle many deployments – just one file or directory.
                            </li>
                            
                      </ol>
                  </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>disadvantages of monolithic architecture</h2>
                  <p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                            Making changes. It is harder to implement changes in such a large and complex application 
                            with highly tight coupling. Any code change affects the whole system so 
                            it has to be thoroughly coordinated. This makes the overall development process much longer.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Flexibility: Monolithic architecture is not flexible. We can’t use different technologies.
                             The technology stack is decided at the start and followed throughout. 
                             Once development matures, sometimes it becomes difficult 
                            to upgrade the technology stack versions, let alone incrementally adopt a newer technology.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            New technology barriers. It is extremely problematic to apply
                             a new technology in a monolithic application because then the entire application has to be rewritten.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Continuous deployment:  Continuous deployment is extremely difficult. 
                            Large monolithic applications are actually an obstacle to frequent deployments.
                             In order to update one component, we have to redeploy the entire application.
                          </li>
                      </ol>
                  </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>Benefits of microservices architecture</h2>
                  <p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                            Better scalability. Another advantage of the microservices approach is that each element
                             can be scaled independently. So the entire process is more cost- and time-effective 
                             than with monoliths when the whole application has to be scaled even if there is no need in it.
                              In addition, every monolith has limits in terms of scalability, so the more users you acquire, 
                              the more problems you have with your monolith.
                             Therefore, many companies, end up rebuilding their monolithic architectures. 
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Flexibility: Microservices architecture is quite flexible. Different microservices can be developed 
                            in different technologies. Since a microservice is smaller, the code base is quite less,
                             so it’s not that difficult to upgrade the technology stack versions.
                             Also, we can incrementally adopt a newer technology without much difficulty.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Easier understanding. Split up into smaller and simpler components,
                             a microservice application is easier to understand and manage. 
                            You just concentrate on a specific service that is related to a business goal you have.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Development speed: Development is pretty fast in microservices architecture.
                             Since the volume of code is much less for a microservice, it’s not difficult for 
                             new team members to understand and modify the code. They become productive right from the start.
                              Code quality is maintained well. The IDE is much faster. A microservice takes much
                               less time to start up.
                             All these factors considerably increase developers' productivity. 
                          </li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Extra complexity. Since a microservices architecture is a distributed system, 
                            you have to choose and set up the connections between all the modules and databases. Also, as long as such 
                            an application includes independent services, all of them have to be deployed independently.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            System distribution. A microservices architecture is a complex 
                            system of multiple modules and databases so all the connections have to be handled carefully.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cross-cutting concerns. When creating a microservices application, 
                            you will have to deal with a number of cross-cutting concerns.
                             They include externalized configuration, logging, metrics, health checks, and others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Testing. A multitude of independently deployable components makes testing a microservices-based solution much harder.
